     - Styles for forms, tables, and buttons.
     - Navigation bar styling.

2. **`js/main.js`**:
   - **Purpose**: Contains JavaScript for dynamic interactions (e.g., form submissions).
   - **Key Features**:
     - Handles form submissions for adding/updating products, sales, restocks, and invoices.
     - Makes API calls to the backend using `fetch`.

### **4. Root Folder**
This folder contains configuration files and the main entry point for your application.

#### **Files in the Root Folder:**

1. **`inventory.db`**:
   - **Purpose**: SQLite database file where all data is stored.
   - **Note**: This file is automatically created when you initialize the database.

2. **`README.md`**:

### **How Everything Works Together**

1. **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)**:
   - The `templates/` folder contains HTML files that define the structure of your web pages.
   - The `static/` folder contains CSS and JavaScript files that add styling and interactivity to your web pages.

2. **Backend (FastAPI)**:
   - The `app/` folder contains the backend logic, including database models, CRUD operations, and API routes.
   - FastAPI serves the HTML templates and handles API requests from the frontend.

3. **Database (SQLite)**:
   - The `inventory.db` file stores all the data for your application.
   - SQLAlchemy is used to interact with the database from the backend.

4. **Root Folder**:
   - Contains configuration files and the main entry point for your application.

### **Example Workflow**

1. **User Visits the Homepage**:
   - The browser sends a request to the `/` route.
   - FastAPI serves the `index.html` template.

2. **User Adds a Product**:
   - The user fills out the form on the `products.html` page and clicks "Add Product".
   - JavaScript sends a POST request to the `/products/` route with the form data.
   - FastAPI processes the request, creates a new product in the database, and returns the updated product list.

3. **User Edits a Product**:
   - The user clicks "Edit" on a product in the `products.html` page.
   - The browser navigates to the `/products/{product_id}/edit` route.
   - FastAPI serves the `edit_product.html` template with the product details pre-filled.
   - The user updates the product and clicks "Update Product".
   - JavaScript sends a PUT request to the `/products/{product_id}` route with the updated data.
   - FastAPI processes the request, updates the product in the database, and returns the updated product.
